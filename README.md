# 3star2022-Reversal-Engine
An unofficial engine for ninjamuffin's 『さかさま MOOD』 game (IT HASN'T BEEN UPLOADED YET)

Reversal Engine is an unofficial engine for ninjamuffin99's game 『さかさま MOOD』(Reversed Mood) made for the 3 star game jam.
Once I saw the game was open-source I started messing around and ended up changing a ton of stuff.

``Reversal Engine's Features``
(1.0)
- Cleaned up and redone a lot of the game's code.
- Added the option to close the game by pressing ESCAPE on the titlescreen.
- Added the option to reset the game by hitting R or BACKSPACE on you keyboard.
- Added Icons to the game when you build it.
- Added the option to skip the cutscene when the game starts up.
- Added a new health system so that the amount of hearts you have isn't dependent on your spritesheet.
